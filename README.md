# College-Stationery-Shop-Python-Program
This project is a college stationery shop billing system built using Python. It allows students to:
* View a list of stationery items along with their prices
* Select multiple items to purchase
* Enter the quantity for each item
* Automatically calculate the cost of each item and the total amount
* Generate a clear final bill showing all items and the total cost

The program is menu-driven and includes input validation to handle wrong entries. It uses Python dictionaries to store item names and prices, lists to keep track of purchases, and loops to allow multiple selections.
The project is designed using the top-down approach, which means the problem was broken into smaller parts like:

1. Displaying the item menu
2. Taking user choice
3. Calculating the cost
4. Adding items to the bill
5. Asking the user if they want to buy more
6. Generating the final bill
